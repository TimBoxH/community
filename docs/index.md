# Welcome to the Single Source Publishing Community

`#SSPC`

The Single Source Publishing Community (SSPC) is a network stakeholders from the Open Science community that are interested in [Single Source Publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-source_publishing) (SSP) for scholarly purposes – developing open-source software and advocacy.   

> Single Source Publishing is an approach to publishing workflows to easily produce diverse publication output formats from only a single data source – e.g., from one dataset in Markdown or XML to make a multi-format publications as HTML, PDF, and JATS/XML, etc.

There are many different approaches to SSP and a variety of benefits of SSP on different aspects of the research lifecycle and a goal of the community is to be a meeting place to exchange ideas from these diverse practices.

The community is open to newcomers and experts. 

A number of activities are organised by the community: 

 - a [discussion board](https://github.com/singlesourcepub/community/discussions) to act as a place for Q&As and coordination; 
 - as monthly '[SSPC Show & Tell](https://github.com/singlesourcepub/community/wiki/SSPC-Show-&-Tell)' where participants will be invited to show off their products, projects, and research; lastly 
 - occasional BarCamps / Book Dashes aimed at publishing guides on key SSP topics.
