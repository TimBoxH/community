The Single Source Publishing Community (SSPC) is a network stakeholders from the Open Science community that are interested in [Single Source Publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-source_publishing) (SSP) for scholarly purposes – developing open-source software and advocacy.   

> Single Source Publishing is an approach to publishing workflows to easily produce diverse publication output formats from only a single data source – e.g., from one dataset in Markdown or XML to make a multi-format publications as HTML, PDF, and JATS/XML, etc.

There are many different approaches to SSP and a variety of benefits of SSP on different aspects of the research lifecycle and a goal of the community is to be a meeting place to exchange ideas from these diverse practices.

The community is open to newcomers and experts. 
  
The center of it all is and will be the [discussion page](https://github.com/singlesourcepub/community/discussions) of this project. That's the place where the beat goes on! There, we and you can show and tell what we do, ask and answer questions and inform each other about new projects out on the crazy and ever changing internet.

We kindly ask you to be patient as all of this will take some time. If you [want to help](https://github.com/singlesourcepub/community/discussions/2) please let us know!
